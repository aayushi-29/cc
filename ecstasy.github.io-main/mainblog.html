                <h3>How Faith, Family and a Comedy Career Helped My Recovery</h3>
                <p>I went through nearly 50 years of my life with bipolar 1 disorder — without an accurate diagnosis. I experienced long bouts of depression and mania, resulting in severe mood swings, poor sleep habits, bad financial choices and bursts of sarcasm and anger that drove away people I cared about and ruined countless opportunities. I found myself complaining heatedly that life wasn’t going exactly how I wanted.

                <h3>Finding the Right Treatment Fit</h3>
                <p>As a mental health professional and someone who lives with mental illness, my best advice to others is to address your mental health concerns early — before they snowball or escalate. The ideal conditions for seeking treatment are on your terms and before your symptoms outweigh your capacity to cope.

                <h3>Critical Things to Know About Emotions for Mental Health</h3>
                <p>Over the 18 years I have studied emotions, I have learned things that felt so universally important for health and well-being that I was shocked they weren’t taught earlier in life. I learned trigonometry in high school, which I’ve barely used, but I never learned critical information about emotions (which clearly affect my daily life). </p>

                <h3>Why I’m Not Making Any New Year’s Resolutions</h3>


                <p>
                    If you, like me, have anxiety or struggle with productivity and perfectionism, January can feel like a time of inevitable failure — a month of motivation and determination that dies out in the span of 30 short days (sometimes less).</p>
